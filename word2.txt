You might think that the definition of bad words would be similar around the world 
You wouldnt be entirely right Strong language   swearing profanity whatever you want to call it   is special

If everyday language is like the earths crust and the soil we garden our lives in 

strong language is like volcanoes and geysers erupting through it from the mantle below 
Our social traditions determine which parts of the crust are the thin points Its not enough to 
feel strongly about something it has to have a dominating societal power and control structure attached to it 
Strong language often involves naming things you desire but arent supposed to desire at the very least
 it aims to upset power structures that may seem a bit too arbitrary

We tend to think of swear words as one entity but they actually serve several distinct functions
 Steven Pinker in The Stuff of Thought lists five different ways we can swear descriptively Lets fuck
 idiomatically Its fucked up abusively Fuck you  emphatically This is fucking amazing and cathartically Fuck 
None of these functions require swearwords In Bikol a language of the Philippines theres a special anger vocabulary   many words 
have alternative words that refer to just the same thing but also mean youre angry In Luganda an African language 
you can make a word insulting just by changing its noun class prefix   from a class for persons to a class for certain kinds
 of objects for instance In Japanese you can insult someone badly just by using an inappropriate form of you

Not all taboo language counts as swear words Some taboo language is still strong language 
even if we dont think of it as swearing   racial epithets insults based on disabilities and sexual 
orientation   but some relates to things you avoid naming because of their power Our word bear comes from a word for brown 
that was used in place of the true name of the animal nobody wanted to say its name lest it appear In southern Africa 
some cultures have a respect speech that is imposed on women in regard to their in laws for instance their father in laws 
name is taboo as is any word that sounds like it   but that doesnt turn the father in laws name into an expletive they shout when 
they hurt themselves
